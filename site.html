	<p> The main purpose of Ultimate Frisbee is to get the flying disc to the opposing side in order
		to get a point for your team. Played on a large rectangular field, the defense team tries to 
		stop the offense team (the team with the disc) to get the disc to the other side. The offense
		(team that has possession of the disc) pass the disc to other players in their team and try to
		forward with the disc. No physical contact is permitted in a game, as it is called a foul.</p>
