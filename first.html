   <p> <span>You</span> may be thinking that Ultimate Frisbee is just where people throw a plate shaped object around (referred to as a flying disc) and basically 
       there is nothing to it. To be open to you all, I have thought the same myself, until I actually started to be engaged
       and saw there is quite more to it than that. </p>

  <p> To give you a brief definition of Ultimate Frisbee, it is a non-contact sport played with flying disc. It has mixed elements from other compelling sports 
      such as football, basketball and rugby, instead having a flying disc substituted with the ball. Ultimate Frisbee advocates for strong competition along with 
      a compromised sportmanship and fair play. This sport is also self-refereed, meaning that there is a lack of referees and players are expected to call out others
      mistakes and speak up about rules that have been broken.</p>

   <p> Ultimate Frisbee is played as a one-gender team, or even mixed! It is open to people of all ages and with any level of skills they have, even if it is none! This 
       compelling, but engaging sport allows players to develop a wide range of athletic and tactical skills while maintaining respect for the opponent and other team players!
