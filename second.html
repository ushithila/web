<h1 style="text-align:center;"> The Rules for Ultimate </h1>
  <p> Just like any other sport, Ultimate Frisbee has its own sets of rules!</p>
   
  <p> The rules of Ultimate is quite, complicated per se, and I am not one to explain all of it since I too am still learning and developing in Ultimate Frisbee (sorry).
       Instead, I will list the most basic rulings for Ultimate and what you should know before you start playing the sport! </p>
   
   <h2> Simple Rules in Ultimate! </h2>

<div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">1. The field:</strong> Of course, ultimate is mainly an outdoor sport, but can be played indoors too. It is usually played on a rectangular grass 
  or beach field, with the end zones (where players score) on each side being about 18 meters. The playing field would usually be about 64 meters by 36 meters, resulting on the whole 
   field to be 100 meters (pretty big if you ask me!). 
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  
  <strong style="font-size:20px">2. Playing:</strong> Each team will have seven players on each side.  The teams would start on their own end zones in the beginning of the game. The defending team 
will start the play by throwing the disc (called the pull) to the offense team. When the disc is thrown, players are expected to run to the  playing field and line with their offenser/defenser and form 
what is called a stack. The main goal in the game is to get the flying disc to the other end zone for the point. 
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">3. Scoring:</strong> When the offense team (the players who have the disc) gets the disc to the end zone of the defense team, they score a point. After the point is scored, 
  the game would then have the scoring team as the defenders and the other team as offense.
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">4. Movement of the disc:</strong> The disc can be thrown in any direction of the field, as long as it doesn't go over the playing field. It must be passed to other players on 
  your team. Whenever a player has possession of the disc (known as the thrower), they are mandated to not run or move with the disc but stay in their place and throw the disc to any of 
  their teammates with a 10 second limit of having the disc. The person defending the thrower (called the marker) must count loudly to 10.
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">5. Turnovers:</strong> When a pass is incomplete (like the disc isn't caught by another player), it would go to the defending team. The teams would switch roles (defending would become offense and vice versa).
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">6. Subs:</strong> Players are able to switch out after the round or if injured during the game, and is replaced with a substitute player.
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">7. Fouls:</strong> Just like any other sports, Ultimate Frisbee has its own sets of limitations. If a player is in contact with another player, it results in a foul.
  The offense team would remain in possession and the play is restarted. If players cannot come to agreement for the foul, the previous thrower would throw the disc again.
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">8. Refereeing:</strong> Ultimate is self-refeeral, meaning there are no refrees. Players are expected to point out fouls and has to resolve any disputes about the foul.
  </div>
  <div class="important">
  <strong style="font-size:20px">9. Spirit of the Game:</strong> Ultimate Frisbee encourage players to compete to their highest standard while maintaining respect for others and having great sportmanship, playing by the rules, and 
  of course, having fun!
